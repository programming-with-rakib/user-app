           <small>A country is a distinct territorial body or political entity. It is often referred to as the land of an individual's birth, residence or citizenship.

            A country may be an independent sovereign state or part of a larger state,<strong>[1] </strong>as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, a physical territory with a government, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. It is not inherently sovereign.

            Countries can refer both to sovereign states and to other political entities,<strong>[2] </strong>while other times it can refer only to states.<strong>[3] </strong>For example, the CIA World Factbook uses the word in its "Country name" field to refer to "a wide variety of dependencies, areas of special sovereignty, uninhabited islands, and other entities in addition to the traditional countries or independent states".<strong>[4]</strong>[note 1]

            The largest country in the world by geographical area is Russia, while the most populous is China, followed by India, the United States, Indonesia, Pakistan and Brazil.[13] The newest UN member is South Sudan, followed by Montenegro. Admission of new members requires the approval of the General Assembly; and UN membership has since 1991 been reserved to sovereign states.</small>

            <h3>The United Nations</h3>
            <p>The United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs annually produces the World Economic Situation and Prospects report that classified states as developed countries, economies in transition, or developing countries. The report classifies country development based on per capita gross national income. Within the broad categories, the United Nations identified subgroups based on geographical location or ad hoc criteria. The UN outlines the geographical regions for developing economies as Africa, East Asia, South Asia, Western Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean. The 2019 report recognizes only developed countries in North America, Europe, and Asia and the Pacific. The majority of economies in transition and developing countries are found in Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean.</p>
